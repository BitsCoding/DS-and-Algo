# Multiples of 2 and 3

If we list all the natural numbers upto `10` that are multiples of `2` or `3`, we get `2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9` and `10`. The sum of these multiples is `42`.

Find the sum of all the multiples of `2` and `3` upto `N`.

## Input Format

First line contains `T` that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by `T` lines, each containing an integer, `N`.

## Output Format

For each test case, print an integer on a new line that denotes the sum of all the multiples of `2` and `3` upto `N`.

## Explanation 0

For `N = 10`, if we list all the natural numbers upto `10` that are multiples of `3` or `5`, we get `2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9` and `10`. The sum of these multiples is `42`.  
Similarly for `N = 25`, we get `204`.  
For `N = 100`, we get `3417`.  
For `N = 60`, we get `1230`.
