# Pattern Guessing

Krishna Being tired with the usual coding rounds, he started growing his interest towards a different type of coding when he won the event in his college IERT. He wondered if his friend has the brain to quickly identify the pattern and verify if his inputs are correct or not. From the example portion given below, where you will be given a number `N` and its output `M`, using this find the pattern.

Your task is that from the pattern you identified, You have to tell if for the given `N` whether the given `M` is the correct answer or not?

Example to Identify the Pattern:
```
N              M
10             55
20             210
5              15
0              0
1              1
2              3
```
## Input Format

- The first line consists of `t`, the number of test cases.
- The next `t` lines consists of two space-separated integer, `N` and `M`.

## Output Format

For each `N` and `M` output `1` if `M` is the corresponsing input for the value of `N` otherwise output `0`.

## Sample Input 0
```
4
10 55
4 11
2 3
6 21
```

## Sample Output 0
```

9 45
11 61
13 91
15 120
17 151
19 190
21 230
```

## Sample Output 1
```
